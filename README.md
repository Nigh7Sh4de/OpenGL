Hello World!
Welcome to my very first Github repo!

Here you will (hopefully, assuming I actually use it) find a bunch of super-simple mini-projects that I will have made while learning the awesome library "OpenGL" in C++.

I will be using Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate (until 2013 comes out) as my main IDE, although I do have a strong affection towards minimalist IDE's ( MinGW + Notepad++ = :] ) so I may end up switching IDE's several times.
