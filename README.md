Puny OpenGL Examples of Terrible Code :)
========================================
Hello World!
Welcome to my very first Github repo!

Here you will (hopefully, assuming I actually use it) find a bunch of super-simple mini-projects that I will have made while learning the awesome library "OpenGL" in C++.

I will be using MinGW command line with Notepad++ because MSVS is BEYOND TERRIBLE for C++ (I mean it took me 4 hours to set up a custom batch build script and all my libs and includes and not to mention learned a lot along the way, but I had spent MUCH longer on it last time I tried with MSVS2012 Ultimate)

Projects
--------
At the moment there is only 1 project in this repo:

Contains a blank window which is basically just a Proof of Concept for my build script and OpenGL & other libraries installation
